 🧑‍💻 Personal Portfolio Website

This is my first personal portfolio website, built from scratch using:

-HTML – For the structure  
-CSS – For custom styling with a modern dark theme  
-Bootstrap – For responsive layout and clean UI  
-JavaScript – For basic interactivity  



🚀 Features

- 📄 **About Me** – Short personal introduction  
- 🛠️ **Projects** – Showcase of selected work  
- ✉️ **Contact** – Form to connect with me  


📱 Responsive Design

The website is mobile-friendly and works well on all screen sizes using Bootstrap.
